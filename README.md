# svg-logo-fixed

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to build a command-line app that allows users to generate an svg logo from scratch given proper installation and usage instructions.
- I built this project to provide a logo generator to those that might not otherwise know how to create one.

## Installation

- Install node.js and install "inquirer" as an npm package (version 8.2.4).

## Technology Used

- JavaScript

## Usage

- Clone this repository and open with vscode. Right click on the index.js file in your directory and click on "Open in integrated terminal". When the integrated terminal appears in the bottom portion of your screen input "node index.js" and press ENTER to begin the svg logo generator. Please answer all questions that appear in your terminal until you see a message that states "Generated logo.svg".
